# Usage

Using `docker-compose`:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  money-balancer:
    image: ghcr.io/dorianim/money-balancer
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 8000:8000
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    environment:
      - JWT_SECRET=some_super_secret_secret
```

Using `docker`:

```bash
docker run -p8000:8000 -e JWT_SECRET=some_super_secret_secret -v $(pwd)/data:/data ghcr.io/dorianim/money-balancer
```

You can then access money-balancer on [`http://localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000). The API documentation can be found at [`http://localhost:8000/api/v1`](http://localhost:8000/api/v1).

# How debts are split up:

- amount / debtors
- the potential rest is assigned to people who have to overpay
- who has to overpay is determined by how often they have overpaid in the past in this specific group

# Development

You need `cargo` and `yarn` installed on your system. You can build everything using

```
cargo build
```

This will create a static binary in `target/debug/money-balancer` which you can run.
